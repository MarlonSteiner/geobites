## Building
The Le Wagon docs had most of what I needed. Most of the app felt quite easy to code, the front-end especially considering I used bootstrap and spacers from SCSS. The login was built with the Devise gem. I could have also used a gem for the bookmark feature but decided that I wanted a challenge. For the most part- the project is an accumulation of simpler versions of other projects I've worked on. It just felt perfect for CS50. I originally had a python quiz app which I almost completed 6 months prior finishing this. However, doing a bootcamp in-between and switching to ruby made me want to build my final project with my lastest learnings. I did enjoy making this app!

## Design Choices
The whole brainstorming phase to Ideation of the design was on Figma and I'm satisfied how I was able to built it exactly how I envisioned it. Clean and Sleek was the goal!
